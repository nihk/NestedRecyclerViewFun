# NestedRecyclerViewFun

A simple project demo'ing a vertical RecyclerView with nested horizontal RecyclerViews. 

This is modeled on https://github.com/jeffreyliu8/Nested-RecyclerView but adds saved state
management to it, so that the inner horizontal RecyclerView scroll positions are saved
and restored after a configuration change or process death.
